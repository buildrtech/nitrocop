/// Checks for `# rubocop:disable` comments that can be removed.

/// This cop is special: it requires post-processing knowledge of which cops
/// actually fired offenses, so the detection logic lives in `lint_source_inner`
/// in `src/linter.rs`. This struct exists so the cop name is registered and
/// can be referenced in configuration (enabled/disabled/excluded).
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-08)
///
/// FP=19 regressed because moved legacy directives like
/// `# rubocop:disable Style/MethodName` and `# rubocop:disable Metrics/LineLength`
/// stopped suppressing their current cops, so nitrocop started reporting the
/// directives themselves as redundant. Fixed centrally in `parse/directives.rs`
/// by honoring moved legacy names whose short name is unchanged.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-24)
///
/// FN=1102: The `is_directive_redundant` function was too conservative — it
/// never flagged unused directives for enabled cops (to avoid FPs from detection
/// gaps). RuboCop flags ANY unused directive as redundant if the cop is known.
/// Changed to match RuboCop: if a disable directive was unused and the cop is
/// in the registry and enabled, flag it. This trades a small risk of FPs (from
/// nitrocop detection gaps) for reducing ~1100 FNs.
