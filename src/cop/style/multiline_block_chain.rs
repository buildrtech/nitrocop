/// ## Corpus investigation history
///
/// ### Location fix (2026-03-18)
/// Changed offense location from method name (message_loc) to the dot operator
/// (call_operator_loc) before the chained method. RuboCop reports the offense
/// at `range_between(receiver.loc.end.begin_pos, send_node.source_range.end_pos)`,
/// which starts at the block closing delimiter. The corpus comparison uses
/// line:col, and the dot is the correct location for matching.
///
/// ### Previous failed attempt (commit 38898a01, reverted f8166f95)
/// Combined TWO changes: location fix + intermediate chain walk. The chain walk
/// was too aggressive, swinging from FN=162 to FP=212. The location-only fix
/// was separated out as the safe first step.
///
/// ### Fix (2026-03-23): Location + intermediate chain walk
/// Two root causes for FP=150, FN=304:
///
/// 1. **Location mismatch (~150 FP + ~150 FN):** nitrocop reported at the dot
///    operator (`.`) which is often on the line after `end`/`}`. RuboCop reports
///    at the closing delimiter of the receiver block (`end`/`}`). When the dot
///    is on a new line after `end`, nitrocop's line was off by 1 from RuboCop,
///    creating paired FP/FN entries. Fix: report at the end offset of the
///    receiver block's closing delimiter (the `end`/`}` position).
///
/// 2. **Missing intermediate chain walk (~154 FN):** For patterns like
///    `a do..end.c1.c2 do..end`, RuboCop's `send_node.each_node(:call)` walks
///    through ALL call nodes in the send chain, finding that `.c1`'s receiver
///    is the multiline block. nitrocop only checked the immediate receiver of
///    the outer call. Fix: walk the receiver chain through non-block intermediate
///    CallNodes until we find a call whose receiver is a multiline block. We
///    stop (break) on the first match, matching RuboCop's `break` after
///    `add_offense`.
